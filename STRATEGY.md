# Rat Scramble Strategy Brief (Agent Prompt Optimized)

Use this as operational guidance every round.

## Core Priorities

1. Legal action first: never waste turns on illegal token grabs.
2. Preserve leverage: keep a 3-token reserve when possible for `force_with_three_tokens`.
3. Majority by default: pursue consensus only when bells + effect are clearly better.
4. Contract clarity: make narrow promises with explicit trigger conditions.
5. Tempo matters: avoid negotiation deadlocks; secure legal tokens early.

## Negotiation Protocol

- State: preferred proposal + target outcome (majority/consensus).
- Explain: why it helps others (effect safety, avoid-season protection).
- Trade: one concrete future commitment with a clear trigger.
- Keep messages concise and specific; avoid vague future support.
- After taking a vote token, stop making new binding agreements.

## Contract Discipline

- Do not stack overlapping promises that can trigger in the same round.
- If obligations conflict, declare a deterministic priority rule before voting.
- Honor triggered commitments proactively to avoid referee enforcement.

## Vote Manipulation Heuristics

- `use_target_token`: cheap, situational, lower reliability.
- `force_with_three_tokens`: expensive, high reliability, use as finisher.
- Save late-round vote changes for decisive moments.
- Track the max-2-vote-changes-per-target cap.

## Proposal Type Playbook

- Max (`AAA/AAAB`): concentrated scoring; strong for aligned players, feared by opponents.
- Spread (`ABC/AAAD`): coalition compromise when table is fragmented.
- Wild (`AAA/BBDD`): high swing; commit only with clear outcome control.
- Rivalry (`AAB/BBAA`): coalition knife-edge; often best with precise 3-vote control.
- Upset (`ABB/ACCD`): anti-anchor pivot; useful for breaking predictable A-season plans.

## Effect-Aware Rules

- Price in effect risk before bells, especially disruptive events.
- Use threatening effects as bargaining leverage to drive safer outcomes.
- Null outcomes are often efficient because they reduce coordination risk.

## Character Reminders

- Carmichael: secure Winter, but avoid overpromising future support.
- Quincy: optimize Autumn/Winter and punish Spring-heavy lines.
- Medici: aggressively convert Summer windows; avoid Winter accumulation.
- D'Ambrosio: maximize Spring/Summer, avoid feeding Autumn growth.

## Fast Checklist (Before Final Vote)

1. Is my token/action legal now?
2. Which commitments are truly triggered this round?
3. Majority or consensus: which is actually better on this card/effect pair?
4. Do I need to reserve 3 tokens for a decisive force?
5. What is the likely final-voter manipulation sequence?
